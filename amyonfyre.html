I'm also The Mediator and forever Switzerland with an uncanny (and sometimes annoying) knack for seeing and feeling both sides of an issue.

                <h2>Divorce: I had to hit rock bottom</h2>
                <p>In the decade-plus that I lived with my ex-husband’s alcohol abuse, I kept waiting for him to hit rock bottom. Every time I thought he must finally be there, he would just keep on going and nothing would change. It was confusing. Doesn’t every addict hit rock bottom eventually?

                    Or…..
                    
                    Maybe I was the one who had to hit it.</p>
